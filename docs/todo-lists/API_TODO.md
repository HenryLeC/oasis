## üïê Oasis Todo: GraphQL Backend API _(`@oasis/api`)_

- [x] Create a boilerplate GraphQL API with `apollo-server-micro`
- [ ] Add queries for `posts` and `comments`
  - [x] Basic Implementation
  - [x] Connect the 2 with GraphQL
  - [ ] Change code to work with Firebase Database References
- [ ] Add queries for `user` and `repos`
  - [x] Add `allUsers`, `getUser`, `allRepos`, `getRepo` queries
  - [ ] Connect the 2 with GraphQL (directly with Firebase DB Refs this time)
- [ ] Add rate limiting
- [ ] Add mutations
  - [ ] Posts
  - [ ] Comments
  - [ ] Repos
  - [ ] Users
- [ ] Pagination for the `all(...)` fields, I'm choosing to do this after they have already been implemented
- [ ] Possibly keep GQL Playground in Production
